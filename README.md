The aim of this project is to evaluate the “customer-satisfaction with hospital” using both Twitter data plus and Government Data  .
Our project will help patients and the Brisbane city council to understand customer satisfaction based on both twitter data based on open government  data .  We will analyse the data and visualise the routes according to customer satisfaction. Hospitals and Tweets from three regions:  Brisbane, Gold Coast and Ipswich  are analysed.  Thus, this project will enable patients and these three city councils to reduce the cost, to find a better clinic place  and to improve customer satisfaction in near-real time.  It will help patients or health researchers to find a good hospital without lots of complaints!
