# HealthOMeter

The aim of this project is to evaluate the “customer-satisfaction with hospital” using both Twitter data plus and Government Data  .
Our project will help patients and the Brisbane city council to understand customer satisfaction based on both twitter data based on open government  data .  We will analyse the data and visualise the routes according to customer satisfaction. Hospitals and Tweets from three regions:  Brisbane, Gold Coast and Ipswich  are analysed.  Thus, this project will enable patients and these three city councils to reduce the cost, to find a better clinic place  and to improve customer satisfaction in near-real time.

The latitude and longitude of Tweets was extraced. The postcode was assigned. Thus we built the barchat according to postcode. 

The opinion of the Tweets was extracted according to sentimetal analysis methods. The smail icon means postive. 

Our project will help patients or health researchers to understand the social opnion of hospital withou to do manual survey!
